<h1>TOP-AdminDashboard</h1>
<h2>Before Starting</h2>
<div>For this project I will attempt to recreate the dashboard design provided at <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard">"Project: Admin Dashboard"</a>.</div>
<div>I will use mostly grid for this task as it's the most recent subject I've been learning about on the lectures. I expect this project to be somewhat easy, although I'm sure I'll get stuck in the little details.</div>
